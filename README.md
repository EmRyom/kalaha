Before playing this game, make sure you have termcolor installed. You can install it easily by opening the command line and entering:

pip install termcolor

Then you can open textui.py in any python enabled IDE and run the script to play the game. You can try to beat our algorithm. Good luck (you'll need it).

You can play against minimax at a different depth level. The default is 6, you can change it in the function 'aiInput' in the file 'textui.py' when it calls 'judge'.
